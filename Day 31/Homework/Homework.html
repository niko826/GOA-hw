    <h2 style="color: #1DB954 ; " >what is proggraming?</h2>
    <h3 style="color: #d4d4d4;">Programming is the process of writing instructions that a computer can understand and execute.
        These instructions—called code—are written in programming languages like Python, JavaScript, or C++. The goal is to solve problems, automate tasks, or build things like websites, apps, games, or even control robots.
        In simple terms:
        Programming is like giving a very precise recipe to a computer so it knows exactly what to do, step by step.

    <h2 style="color: #1DB954;">Why do we need proggraming?</h2>
    <h3 style="color: #d4d4d4;">We need programming because it's how we tell computers what to do. It allows us to:

        Automate tasks – from simple calculations to managing global logistics.
        
        Solve complex problems – like analyzing climate data, simulating medical procedures, or predicting market trends.
        
        Create technology – including websites, apps, games, and software that power modern life.
        
        Connect systems – like integrating databases, APIs, and devices in the Internet of Things (IoT).
        
        Empower innovation – enabling new tools in AI, robotics, healthcare, and beyond.
        
        In short, programming is the foundation of nearly all modern digital systems. It's how we build and improve the tools that run the world.

<h3 style="color: #d4d4d4;">Programming is the process of giving computers instructions through code. It involves using languages like Python, JavaScript, or C++ to build software, websites, apps, and automate tasks. Core concepts include variables, loops, functions, and data structures. Programming powers nearly all modern technology—from web apps and games to artificial intelligence and robotics. It's a highly valuable skill for problem-solving, innovation, and creating digital tools.
