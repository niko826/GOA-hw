<p><b>Donatello</b> <u>(c. 1386–1466)</u>was an Italian sculptor and a key figure of the Early Renaissance. He brought lifelike emotion and realism to sculpture, breaking from the stiff medieval style.

    He's best known for his bronze David—the first free-standing nude statue since ancient times—and his powerful Gattamelata equestrian statue. Donatello's work set the stage for later masters like Michelangelo.</p>
