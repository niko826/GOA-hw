    <p>Raphael full name: <b>Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino</b>, <u></u> 1483–1520 </u> was an Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance, known for his incredibly graceful and harmonious works.

        Hes especially famous for his Madonnas (like The Sistine Madonna) and large-scale frescoes in the Vatican, particularly The School of Athens, which beautifully blends art, philosophy, and perspective. His style was admired for its clarity, balance, and ideal beauty.
        
        Raphael was younger than Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, and he actually learned from both—he studied Leonardo’s techniques and even competed with Michelangelo during his career. Sadly, he died young, at just 37, but left behind a legacy that hugely influenced Western art.</p>
