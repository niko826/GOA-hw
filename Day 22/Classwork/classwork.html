    <p><u><b>Leonardo da Vinci</b> (1452–1519)</u> was a true Renaissance genius—an Italian polymath known for his extraordinary talents in art, science, engineering, anatomy, and invention. He’s best known for iconic artworks like the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, but he also sketched futuristic machines, studied human anatomy in detail, and made discoveries in fields ranging from botany to hydraulics. His notebooks are filled with brilliant ideas centuries ahead of their time. Leonardo perfectly embodied the spirit of curiosity and creativity that defined the Renaissance.</p>
